Encouraging voter turnout is a longstanding challenge in democratic elections, and campaigns often use strategies like postcards to influence civic participation. In this analysis, we examine data from a 2006 field experiment in Michigan involving over 180,000 registered voters to assess whether sending postcards can increase primary election turnout â€” with the goal of informing similar efforts in the upcoming Texas gubernatorial election. However, our model may be limited by the assumption that the treatment effects observed in Michigan in 2006 will remain stable and representative when applied to a different population, time, and political context in Texas.
